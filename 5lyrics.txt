Autumn leaves
The falling leaves drift by my window
The falling leaves of red and gold
I see your lips the summer kisses
The sunburned hands I used to hold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say
What can you say when a love affair is over
Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just stare in icy silence
What was I to do
What can one do when a love affair is over	

Moon river
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

Bodom after midnight
got to go
Preview what they ought a know
Keep your head down and fucking die
(Wake up) rise and shine
Gotta take another pint
Dig heads and watch out for the night
When the sun comes down and the moon comes up in the sky
The battle of the day and the night
go fuck another one
Candlelight burns in a wood so high
On a carpet (flying high) take it down to the other side
The way beyond it may lie
When the moon comes up and is rescuing under the night
The reaper is on the other side, let's go
Bodom after midnight
Bodom after midnight yeah

Enduring the Eternal Molestation of Flame
Let not my corpse rot in the necropolis
Let not my crimes be raised against me whilein the earth
Make my flesh and bones safe from maggots
And any false god who trepasses my tomb
You whose heart has been seized from thy breast
Save me from the ravages of deacay
The crawlingfeinds who take away limbs
Corpses who deny the inevitable truth
The lifetime of osiris is the sky and theirs is the ground
Save me from those imprisoned in the duat
Who know not yet they are already dead
Save me from the rotting dead
Who sleep inside their corpses
Whose breath becomes fire inside their water
At whose burning the sea rises at dawn
Grant methe immolating flame
Burn my sarcophagus
In opposition to the lords of eternity
I beg you
Prevent my corpse from putrefying in the realm of the dead
Enduring the eternal molestation of flame
The life time of osiris is the sky and theirs is the ground
